You are working on the CertAnalyzer homepage (minimal, professional, modern). Goal: improve conversion and clarity without major redesign. Implement the following as separate, discrete tweaks. Do each task fully, test visually, then move to the next.

IMPORTANT
- Keep the existing clean layout and spacing.
- Do not add new pages.
- Prefer small, high-impact changes.
- Ensure responsive behavior on mobile.
- Do not introduce any unverified claims (only use copy that is true based on current implementation).

========================================
TASK 1 — Restore a real above-the-fold hero (highest priority)
========================================
Problem: The homepage lost a clear H1/value prop above the fold. “Minutes, not hours” appears too far down.

Do:
1) Add a clear H1 + subhead in the top section (left of the preview card).
2) Keep the top nav and existing CTA layout, but make the hero text clearly dominant.

Hero copy (use exactly):
- H1: "Ontario status certificate review in under 2 minutes."
- Subhead: "Red flags, key numbers, missing disclosures, and page-cited findings—exportable for your client file."
- Trust bullets (small line under subhead): "Page citations · Auto-delete controls · No training on your data"
- Primary CTA button label: "Analyze Status Certificate"
- Secondary CTA button label: "View Demo Report"

Acceptance checks:
- On desktop: H1 visible above the fold with the preview.
- On mobile: H1 + CTA appear before the preview.

========================================
TASK 2 — Unify CTA language site-wide
========================================
Problem: Inconsistent CTA labels reduce clarity.

Do:
1) Replace any “Analyze Certificate” / similar variations with: "Analyze Status Certificate"
2) Ensure the top-right header button matches the hero CTA label.
3) Confirm only one primary CTA style (same color, same padding, same hover).

Acceptance checks:
- CTA label is identical in header + hero + bottom CTA.
- No duplicate conflicting CTAs in the same viewport.

========================================
TASK 3 — Make “Page citations” a first-class differentiator (near the top)
========================================
Problem: Page citations is a key trust feature (especially for lawyers) but currently appears lower.

Do:
1) Ensure “Page citations” is either:
   - Included in the trust bullets under the hero (already), AND
   - Also visible in the “Minutes, not hours” feature cards.
2) Adjust the “Minutes, not hours” feature card copy so “Page citations” is explicit and easy to read.

Copy for that card (use exactly):
- Title: "Page citations"
- Body: "Every finding links to a source page for verification."

Acceptance checks:
- Users can see “page citations” within the first ~1–2 scrolls.
- Card text is legible (not low-contrast).

========================================
TASK 4 — Make the hero preview show vivid deal-killers + page refs
========================================
Problem: Preview should immediately communicate value (deal-breaker issues + page references).

Do:
1) In the top preview widget, include 2–3 example items that feel real:
   - “Special assessment: $18,500 due at closing”
   - “Pending litigation slip-and-fall claim”
   - “Reserve fund at 72% of target”
2) Ensure each item shows a small page reference tag (e.g., “p.23”, “p.31”).

Acceptance checks:
- Preview looks credible, not sensational.
- Page tags are visible and consistent with your report UI.

========================================
TASK 5 — Improve readability of the “Minutes, not hours” feature cards
========================================
Problem: Feature strip text is slightly too light/quiet.

Do:
1) Increase body text size slightly and/or increase contrast.
2) Keep the minimal style (no heavy borders).
3) Ensure equal spacing and consistent icon sizing.

Acceptance checks:
- Feature card text is readable on laptop and mobile.
- No visual clutter added.

========================================
TASK 6 — Add a single expectation-setting line about Ontario format + attachments
========================================
Do:
1) Add a short line near the hero subhead or near the step strip:

Copy (use exactly):
"Works with the Ontario standard status certificate form and attachments."

Acceptance checks:
- Doesn’t feel like legalese.
- Visible early but not competing with the H1.

========================================
TASK 7 — Add a small “not legal advice” note near risk claims (not just footer)
========================================
Problem: Having this only in the footer can feel like a “gotcha.” Better to be transparent near risk detection.

Do:
1) Under the “Automatic risk detection” section (or directly beneath the risk cards), add small muted text:

Copy (use exactly):
"Information extraction and issue spotting only. Not legal advice."

Acceptance checks:
- Visible but subtle (small, muted).
- Does not interrupt layout.

========================================
FINAL QA (after all tasks)
========================================
1) Desktop: Check above-the-fold clarity: H1 + subhead + CTA + preview.
2) Mobile: Ensure hero text and CTA appear before preview and no cramped spacing.
3) Confirm no unverified trust claims were added. Keep “SOC 2-ready” only if accurate; otherwise change it to “Security-first” language.
4) Run Lighthouse quickly; ensure no major regressions.
5) Confirm consistent typography, spacing, and CTA styles across sections.

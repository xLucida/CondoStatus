Update the product UX to be property-based and multi-document by default. The reality is 4–15 PDFs per condo property. Do NOT assume a single “status certificate” PDF.

Constraints:
- Keep the current minimal/professional design.
- Do not add new pricing feature tiers; only clarify usage unit.
- Focus on clear UX and correct terminology.

========================
TASK 1 — Replace single-PDF language across the site
========================
Find/replace copy:
- Replace “Upload status certificate” with “Upload condo documents for this property (status certificate + attachments)”
- Replace “Analyze status certificate” CTA with “Analyze Condo Documents” or “Generate Property Report”
- Keep “status certificate” only as a parenthetical descriptor for clarity/SEO.

========================
TASK 2 — Make the upload UI support multiple PDFs (default)
========================
- Update file input to accept multiple files.
- Drag/drop supports multiple PDFs.
- Show a list of selected files with:
  - filename
  - size
  - remove button
- Validate: only PDFs, max total size (use a sensible cap like 75MB total; show error state).
- Update backend API request to send multiple files (or upload individually and link to a propertyId).

========================
TASK 3 — Introduce a “Property” container (required)
========================
Before upload or at top of upload module, require:
- Address (text)
- Unit (optional but recommended)
- City/Province (optional)
On submit, create a propertyId/matterId and associate all uploads to it.

========================
TASK 4 — Optional doc-type tagging per file (lightweight)
========================
In the file list, add an optional dropdown per file:
- Status Certificate
- Budget
- Financial Statements
- Reserve Fund Study
- Insurance Certificate
- Declaration/By-laws/Rules
- Other (default)
Store tags with each file.

========================
TASK 5 — Consolidated report page updates
========================
- Update report header to: “Property Review: {address/unit}”
- Add “Documents included” summary: “12 PDFs · 186 pages · 38MB”
- Update citations to reference BOTH:
  - source filename
  - page number (e.g., “Budget.pdf p.4”)
If there is a PDF viewer, clicking citation should open the correct document and page (if feasible now; otherwise show document name prominently next to page).

========================
TASK 6 — Pricing definition update (copy only)
========================
Update pricing/FAQ copy to reflect multi-PDF property reality:
- “1 Property Review covers one condo unit/address and may include multiple PDFs (status certificate + supplementary docs).”
- “Limits: up to 600 total pages or 75MB per property review; larger packages may require splitting.”

========================
TASK 7 — QA
========================
- Desktop and mobile: multi-PDF upload works, file list scrolls cleanly.
- Confirm no remaining copy implying a single PDF.
- Confirm backend handles multiple PDFs and creates one consolidated result for a propertyId.
- Ensure error states are clear (wrong file type, too large total, missing address).

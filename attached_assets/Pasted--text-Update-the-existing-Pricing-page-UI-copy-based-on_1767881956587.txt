Update the existing Pricing page UI/copy based on the attached screenshot. Goal: tighten clarity and reduce friction for lawyers while keeping the current minimal/professional design and the 3-plan + Contact CTA structure.

Constraints
- Keep the same layout and styling (cards, spacing, typography).
- Plans remain: Pay-as-you-go, Small Practice, Firm (Most popular) + “Need higher volume?” Contact us.
- No feature tiering: the “Included in every plan” list remains shared.
- Do not change the actual prices/quantities unless explicitly stated below.

========================================================
TASK 1 — Fix the definition box copy (remove redundancy + shorten)
========================================================
In the “What counts as a Property Review?” box:
1) Remove the duplicate parenthetical “(one unit/address)” so it doesn’t read “unit/address (one unit/address)”.
2) Replace the current definition paragraph with this exact text:

“One Property Review covers one condo unit/address. Upload the status certificate and related PDFs and get one consolidated report.”

3) Keep the Limits line but shorten it to this exact text:

“Limits: up to 600 total pages or 75 MB across all documents. Larger packages may require splitting (each part counts as a separate Property Review).”

========================================================
TASK 2 — Replace the header subcopy (less defensive)
========================================================
Under “Simple, transparent pricing”, replace:
“Choose the plan that fits your workflow. No feature differences between plans.”
with this exact text:
“Same product on every plan. Pay only for volume.”

========================================================
TASK 3 — Make overage billing behavior explicit near the plans
========================================================
Add a small, subtle line (below the plan cards OR directly under the definition box) with this exact text:
“Overages: we’ll prompt you to approve before any extra charges.”

Make sure this matches the FAQ wording and is visible without scrolling too far.

========================================================
TASK 4 — Improve Pay-as-you-go CTA label (less awkward phrasing)
========================================================
On the Pay-as-you-go card, change the button label from:
“Buy a Property Review”
to:
“Buy 1 Review”

Keep the rest of the Pay-as-you-go card unchanged.

========================================================
TASK 5 — Ensure consistency + QA
========================================================
- Confirm “Property Review” is consistently capitalized across the page.
- Ensure the definition box still appears above the plans.
- Mobile: definition box, plan cards, included list, FAQ all stack cleanly.
- Commit the changes.

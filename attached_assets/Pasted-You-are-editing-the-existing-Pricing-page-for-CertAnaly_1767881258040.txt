You are editing the existing Pricing page for CertAnalyzer. Goal: make it lawyer-first, usage-only (no feature tiering), and align the unit of value to a PROPERTY REVIEW (one condo unit/address) that can include multiple PDFs (often 4–15). Plans differ ONLY by usage and overage rate.

Constraints
- Keep the current visual style (minimal, professional, modern).
- Do NOT introduce feature differentiators between plans. All plans include the same product.
- Plans: ONLY three selectable options: Pay-as-you-go, Small Practice, Firm.
- Optional: add a non-priced “Enterprise” section as a simple “Contact us” CTA (not a plan users can self-select).
- Remove “analysis/credits/checks” language everywhere.
- Do NOT invent backend behavior. If something is not implemented, implement as copy only and add a TODO comment.

========================================================
TASK 1 — Rename the unit everywhere
========================================================
Replace “analysis/analyses/credits/checks” with:
- Primary term: “Property Review”
- Add parenthetical once near the top: “(one unit/address)”
Example:
- “10 Property Reviews / month”
- “Overage: $20 / Property Review”

Ensure consistency across:
- plan cards
- tooltips
- FAQ
- buttons/CTAs

========================================================
TASK 2 — Update the plan grid (3 plans only)
========================================================
Update the plan cards to exactly:

1) Pay-as-you-go
- Title: “Pay-as-you-go”
- Price: “$49”
- Unit: “per Property Review”
- CTA: “Buy a Property Review” (or “Buy Reviews”)
- Small helper line (optional): “Best for occasional files.”

2) Small Practice
- Title: “Small Practice”
- Price: “$149 / month”
- Included: “10 Property Reviews / month”
- Overage: “$20 / Property Review”
- CTA: “Start Small Practice”

3) Firm (Most popular)
- Title: “Firm”
- Badge: “Most popular”
- Price: “$299 / month”
- Included: “35 Property Reviews / month”
- Overage: “$12 / Property Review”
- CTA: “Start Firm”

Remove any other paid tiers from the UI.

========================================================
TASK 3 — Add definition block ABOVE the plan grid
========================================================
Insert a concise block directly below the pricing header.

Heading: “What counts as a Property Review?”
Body (use exactly):
“One Property Review covers one condo unit/address. It can include multiple PDFs (status certificate + supplementary documents) and produces one consolidated report.”

========================================================
TASK 4 — Add package limits (unit definition; not feature gating)
========================================================
Add directly under the definition block (use exactly):
“Limits: up to 600 total pages or 75 MB across all documents for that property. If a package exceeds limits, you may be asked to split it into two parts (each part counts as a separate Property Review).”

========================================================
TASK 5 — Overage billing behavior (do not leave ambiguous)
========================================================
Choose ONE behavior and reflect it in copy + FAQ:

Option A (only if implemented): “Overages are billed automatically at your plan rate.”
Option B (if auto-billing not implemented): “We’ll pause and ask before billing overages.”

Implement ONLY what is true today. If not implemented, add a TODO comment.

========================================================
TASK 6 — Replace per-plan feature lists with ONE shared “Included in every plan”
========================================================
If the current page has per-plan feature bullet lists, remove them.
Add ONE shared list under the cards.

Heading: “Included in every plan”
Bullets (only keep what exists today; remove any that don’t):
- Executive summary and severity overview
- Red flags with page citations
- Key numbers extracted
- Missing / not disclosed detection
- Questions-to-ask checklist
- Exportable report (PDF/print)

========================================================
TASK 7 — Update FAQ to match property-based multi-PDF reality
========================================================
Add/update:

Q: “What counts as a Property Review?”
A: “One Property Review covers one condo unit/address and can include multiple PDFs. It produces one consolidated report.”

Q: “How many documents can I upload for one property?”
A: “A Property Review can include multiple PDFs. Each review covers up to 600 total pages or 75 MB across all documents.”

Q: “What happens if I go over my monthly usage?”
A: Use the exact overage behavior chosen in TASK 5.

Q: “Can I cancel anytime?”
A: “Yes. Your plan remains active until the end of your billing period.” (only if true)

========================================================
TASK 8 — Optional Enterprise CTA (not a plan)
========================================================
If the design has space beneath the plans, add a simple section:

Title: “Need higher volume?”
Body: “For 100+ Property Reviews/month, firm-wide billing, or procurement support.”
CTA: “Contact us”

Do NOT show a price and do NOT add this as a selectable plan.

========================================================
TASK 9 — Visual QA + commit
========================================================
- No remaining “analysis/credits/checks” language.
- Firm plan has “Most popular” badge.
- Definition block is visible before plans (ideally above the fold on desktop).
- Mobile layout clean.
- Commit changes.

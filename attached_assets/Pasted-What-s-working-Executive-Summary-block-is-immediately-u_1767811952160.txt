What’s working

Executive Summary block is immediately useful (risk badge + counts + key headline metric).

Issues Flagged is the right “first stop” and includes page citations, which is your main trust wedge.

Accordion sections (Common Expenses, Reserve Fund, Insurance, etc.) match how people mentally parse these docs.

Per-item page tags on the right are excellent—keeps the “verify in source” behavior native.

Severity styling (Warning vs Low) is clean and not alarmist.

Main risks (fix these to avoid trust/legal problems)

“Low Risk” badge can feel like a legal conclusion.
Keep it, but make it explicitly “issue severity summary” and add a small qualifier:

“Risk summary (issue spotting, not legal advice)” or “Overall: Low flagged risk (based on disclosed info)”

“Not Found” is ambiguous.
Rename to “Missing / Not disclosed” and make it clickable to a list of what’s missing.

High-impact improvements (in priority order)

Add a sticky “Action List” at the top (1 screen, scannable).
Something like:

“3 flagged items to review”

“2 questions to ask property manager”

“1 missing disclosure to confirm”
This is what agents/lawyers actually want before they expand sections.

Add “Questions to Ask” generated from the specific findings (with page refs).
Example:

“Confirm whether any special assessments are proposed but not yet approved (see p. X).”

“Confirm insurance deductible applicability to unit owners (see p. Y).”

Clarify how the key metric is calculated (Reserve/Unit Health 77%).
Add an info tooltip: what inputs, what thresholds, and what “Healthy” means. Otherwise users will distrust it.

Make page citations interactive and audit-friendly.

Clicking “p.12” should open the PDF viewer to that page (or show the excerpt/snippet you relied on).

Add “Copied citation” / “Copy link to finding” for lawyers.

Add a “Decision readiness” box.
“Based on disclosed info, here’s what would typically block firming up:”
Then list only the top 1–3 potential deal-breakers.

Add quick navigation + search.

“Jump to: Issues / Reserve Fund / Insurance / Legal / Governance”

Search within report (even basic) is a big usability win for 50+ page packs.

Export/share controls in the header.

“Download PDF” / “Print” / “Share link”
Put them near the top, not only implied.

Minor UI polish notes

The “Issues Flagged” cards are great—consider default-expanding only the highest severity and collapsing the rest.

Ensure warning colors meet contrast/accessibility standards (yellow on white often fails).

The bottom CTA (“Upload your certificate”) is good; consider making it a sticky CTA for long scrolls.

Net

This page is already in the “credible product” tier. If you add (1) Action List, (2) Missing/Not disclosed detail, and (3) interactive citations, it becomes meaningfully better than “just ask ChatGPT” because it’s verifiable, repeatable, and workflow-shaped.

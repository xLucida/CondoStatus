## Positioning (one sentence)

Turn messy condo status certificates into a **clear, standardized risk report** in minutes so deals close faster and surprises don’t show up after firm conditions.

---

## Best value props to highlight (ranked)

### 1) Speed + clarity

* **“Minutes, not hours.”** Upload → instant executive summary + key numbers.
* Plain-English explanation of what matters (for buyers/agents) without losing legal precision (for lawyers).

### 2) Risk surfacing (the real “why”)

* Automatic **red flags** and “read-this” callouts:

  * Arrears/collections risk
  * Legal actions / liens / chargebacks
  * Insurance gaps / deductibles
  * Reserve fund concerns / major capex
  * Litigation / Tarion/warranty notes (if applicable)
  * Special assessments (current + hinted)
  * Budget variance / fee increases / deficits

### 3) Standardized output (the moat vs “just ask ChatGPT”)

* A consistent **schema** every time (same sections, same metrics, same definitions).
* “What’s missing / unclear” detection (e.g., certificate doesn’t state X → mark as unknown).
* Comparability across properties and deals.

### 4) Decision support artifacts

* **One-page buyer-friendly summary** + **lawyer-grade detail**.
* Export: **PDF report**, shareable link, and “questions to ask the property manager/condo corp.”

### 5) Fewer mistakes, better defensibility

* Checklist-style coverage: “We reviewed: A, B, C; could not verify: D.”
* Versioning (if updated certificate arrives) and change highlights.

### 6) Privacy and control (must-have trust signal)

* “Your documents are sensitive. We don’t train on them.”
* Optional auto-redaction (names, unit numbers) before analysis.
* Data retention controls (delete immediately / 7 days / 30 days).

## Design style preferences (minimal, professional, modern)

### Recommended direction: “Calm enterprise SaaS”

Goal: communicate *trust + precision + speed* (not “AI novelty”).

**Look & feel**

* White / off-white backgrounds, high contrast text
* One restrained accent color (used only for CTAs, highlights, severity tags)
* Lots of whitespace, sharp grid, subtle dividers, soft shadow cards

**Typography**

* Modern sans-serif (clean, not playful)
* Clear hierarchy: big headline, compact subheads, readable body

**UI components to prioritize**

* Upload box with strong affordance (drag/drop)
* “What you’ll get” preview card (sample report screenshot)
* Severity tags: Low / Medium / High (neutral styling, not alarming neon)
* “Red flags” list with expandable detail
* “Key figures” tiles (fees, reserve fund, insurance deductible, etc.)
* “Questions to ask” checklist (copy button)

**Trust cues (above the fold or immediately below)**

* Privacy statement (1 line)
* Data retention control (1 line)
* “Not legal advice” disclaimer (kept small, not scary)

**Layout pacing (landing page)**

1. Hero (headline + upload CTA + trust line)
2. Example output preview (screenshot-style)
3. Red flags section (the “aha”)
4. Who it’s for (buyers, agents, lawyers, investors)
5. Security/privacy
6. Pricing
7. FAQ

---

## Short “who it’s for” framing (helps conversion)

* **Buyers/investors:** “Know what you’re buying before you waive conditions.”
* **Agents:** “Faster guidance for clients, fewer surprises, smoother closes.”
* **Lawyers:** “Structured extraction + issue spotting to speed review (you stay in control).”

If you want a single “best” positioning angle: lead with **risk + speed** (“catch surprises before you firm up”), then back it with **standardized outputs + privacy** (why it’s better than ad hoc AI prompting).
